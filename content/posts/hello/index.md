Hello Friend!

Thanks for reading me.<br>
[Almost 6 million blog posts are written](https://www.worldometers.info/blogs/) every day so I feel very lucky that you are here.

<br>

#### The What and the Why's

I started this blog to share my thought about the craft of programming, about what I know and what I'm learning about.
It is written with three main goals in my mind

- Help people which is starting their careers in Software Engineering to grow as enthusiastic, curious and healthy professionals.

- Achieve mastery by teaching and defeat or at least keep the Impostor Syndrome under control.

- Connect with awesome people who is really passionate about Programming, Science and optimistic about the Future we can build.

<br>
I'm convinced that teaching is a great way to achieve mastery in any domain. 

In order to provide valuable content I must clarify my own understanding and find creative ways to explain things to make them enjoyable. It's a huge challenge that's worth facing.

Gonna make it, can't give up now.

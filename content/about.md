## Hi there

## About Emilio

I'm a self-thought Software Engineer born and raised in Argentina 🇦🇷.

I spent 4 years at Mercado Libre, in Buenos Aires, being part of web, backend and mobile teams. I built large distributed systems and mobile apps at scale. At [MELI](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/meli), I've shipped some parts of the current logistics system - the one that grew to processing around 65M shipments/year in 10+ countries by 2020. It was fun challenge.

Throughout my career I've been lucky to work with inspiring people, on challenging projects, solving interesting problems. On this blog, I'm sharing my learnings on Software Engineering and the craft of programming, specially about "the fuzzy parts" — concepts, data structures, good practices, people, culture and many other aspects that are agnostic to a particular programming language —.

Sometimes, I also share my thoughts about science, global warming and society in <a href="https://twitter.com/emicastroo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" alt="Emilio Castro's Twitter Account">**Twitter**</a> (as everyone else).

In my spare time I enjoy tinkering with software engineering projects which you can see in <a href="https://github.com/emicastro" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" alt="Emilio Castro's Twitter Account">**Github**</a>.  

Tanks for being here! I hope you enjoy the content.

> I would love to contribute to Open Source projects. If you have something awesome to work on, mail [me](mailto:hello@emicastro.com "Send me an email") or send me a DM on Twitter.

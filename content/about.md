## Hi there

![Hello](../img/hello.jpg)

<br>

My name is Emilio Castro.
I'm a Software Engineer born and raised in Buenos Aires, Argentina 🇦🇷.

Here I write about the craft of programming, specially about "the fuzzy parts" — concepts, data structures, best practices, people, culture and many other aspects that are agnostic to a particular programming language —.

Sometimes, I also share my thoughts about science, global warming and society in <a href="https://twitter.com/emicastroo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" alt="Emilio Castro's Twitter Account">**Twitter**</a> (as everyone else).

In my spare time I enjoy tinkering with software engineering projects which you can see in <a href="https://github.com/emicastro" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" alt="Emilio Castro's Twitter Account">**Github**</a>.  

Tanks for being here! I hope you enjoy my content.

<br>

> This year (2020) I want to start contributing to Open Source projects. If you have something awesome to work on, mail [me](mailto:hello@emicastro.com "Send me an email") or send me a DM on Twitter.
